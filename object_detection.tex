\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Tracking}
Visual tracking aims to track a target in subsequent frames, which has many practical applications. Generally speaking, tracking is simpler than detection because the information learned from the object will be reused in the consecutive frames. Moreover, tracking algorithm normally is much faster than detection algorithm since it only needs to precess a small patch around the object rather than the whole image.
% use fewer computational resources
Thanks to these merits, it is often preferred to perform tracking after a target is detected rather than running detection algorithm on every new frame.


Visual tracking has many practical applications in video processing. When a target is located in one frame of a video, it is often useful to track that object in subsequent frames. Every frame in which the target is successfully
tracked provides more information about the identity
and the activity of the target. Because tracking is generally easier than detection, tracking algorithms can use fewer computational resources than running an object detector on every frame.
Visual tracking has received much attention in recent years. A number of robust tracking strategies have been proposed that tolerate changes in target appearance and
track targets through complex motions


In terms of the literatures, the tracking-by-detection methods [10], [11], aim to solve the long-term object tracking problems. The TLD [10] and Struck [11], as the state of the arts, have achieved great performance on benchmarks [27], [28]

% here why deep learning based trackers are not in consideration
Most of these state of the arts have only been tested with GPU acceleration. However,
they demonstrate low efficiency when they operate on specified embedded processors with only CPU.

To realize fast object detection, the proposed detector divides the detection process into two steps: Proposals extraction and proposals classification. In the first step, classical methods

We develop a saliency map pyramid with multiple layers, to enhance the robustness for
scale-varying objects. In this article, a two-layer architecture is adopted, where the input image for the second layer is resized to half the size of the first.

Similar to Detector, the real-time capability of the tracker is
the main performance to be considered. In this system, the the
kernel correlation filter (KCF) tracker [38] is employed owing
to its great real-time capability. As for multiobject tracking task,
multiple KCF trackers are assigned to objects, respectively.

\section{Whycon}
about geometric pattern detection,

One of the classical solution is the Generalized Hough Transform (Ballard 1981) used for finding the parameters of the expected geometrical shapes,, which is
unfortunately computationally demanding.


The detection algorithm searches the image for circular patterns using a combination of flood-fill techniques, adaptive thresholding, and and on-the-fly statistics calculation.

The statistical information gathered on-the-fly is used to test
whether the continuous areas of pixels are likely to represent
the searched pattern, and quickly reject false candidates. 


The main advantage of the method is that it can be initiated from
any position in the image without a performance penalty,
which allows for a simple implementation of pattern tracking.


In a typical situation, the algorithm processes only the area that is occupied by the pattern itself, which results in a significant performance boost.

In the initial phase of the pattern detection, the image is scanned for a continuous segment of black pixels. Segmentation of the pixels into black and white classes employs an adaptive thresholding that ensures good performance of the algorithm under variable light conditions, which is especially important in real-world outdoor experiments. Once a continuous segment of black pixels is found by the floodfill
method, it is tested for minimum size and roundness.


If a black region passes the roundness test, the flood-fill algorithm is initiated from the region’s centroid in order to search for the inner white segment. Again, a roundness score is computed for verification.

Then, the concentricity of segments and the ratio of their areas are tested. After passing these tests, a PCA is used to to find the ellipse parameters.


%cluster each of these datasets into six separate clusters using k-means and then fit PCA subspaces to each of the resulting 12 clusters


%While a lot of the research on object detection has focused on faces, the detection of other objects, such as pedestrians and cars, has also received widespread attention

Perhaps the most famous classical detector is the algorithm developed by Dalal
and Triggs (2005), which is originally used for pedestrian detection. It extracts histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) descriptors and feed them into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

% Each HOG has cells to accumulate magnitude-weighted votes for gradients at particular orientations, just as in the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) developed by Lowe (2004), see the work of Dalal and Triggs (2005) for more implementation details.

% Once the descriptors have been computed, a support vector machine (SVM) is trained
on the resulting high-dimensional continuous descriptor vectors. 


\subsection{CNN}
Ever since its success on imagenet competition, deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the field of computer vision over the last
years. It is now almost the standard tool for a large
variety of computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. 
%significantly boosted the level of performance
New network architectures, layer types, and methods to improve the training efficiency and the performance of the CNNs are proposed at a very rapid pace.

Although existing network architectures vary greatly, there are some elements and operations that are used in most networks. 
A comprehensive summary of common methods and operations in deep learning networks can be found in [20].

Convolutional layers. In a convolutional layer, the input is convolved with a number of convolution kernels to generate the output called feature maps. The trainable kernel weights are normally shared within a layer and applied across the entire input. This parameter sharing is both memory and computationally efficient, and also leads to translational invariance by pooling.

The more modern activation functions are derived from the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) [19] and other variants, e.g. Leaky ReLU, have been proposed recently.

Artificial Intelligence and Statistics. 2011, pp. 315–323.


Generally, a CNN can be divided into two main parts. The first part, often
called the encoder, generates feature maps or feature descriptors to represent
the input image at various levels of detail. The basic building elements of the
encoder are convolutional layers, nonlinear activation functions and pooling
layers. The second part of the CNN utilizes these image representations and is
trained to output e.g. the image object class, the location of a tracked object or
a pixelwise horizon segmentation. The second part in a classification network,
the classifier, often comprises a few fully connected layers, activation layers
and sometimes pooling layers. The final stage of a classification network is a
softmax operation, which outputs the probabilities for each object class.


Transfer learning
Transfer learning is a technique that is widely used within the field of deep learning. Transfer learning means that a network model is trained for one
base task, and the trained model is then reused as the starting point to solve
a second application task. There are two main drivers for using transfer learning.
First, training on the application task can be made with a significantly
smaller number of training images compared to training the full network from
scratch. Provided that the base task is general enough, the learned model only
needs to be fine-tuned when training on the application task. Second, there
is a large gain in training time and thus saving computational resources when
solving the application task. Training the network on the base task with a
huge dataset may take weeks on dedicated hardware. This training time can
be saved when using transfer learning for the application task.


\subsection{MOSSE}


the strength of a correlation peak

can be used to detect occlusions or tracking failure, to stop the online update, and to reacquire the track if the object reappears with a similar appearance.

The tracker follows the object within specified region-of-interest from
frame to frame with lower computing consumption.

One difficulty is that the objects may move out of the camera view frequently due to the fast flight speed of fixed-wing vehicles. Besides, the object appearances vary constantly due to the ever-changing viewpoint and illumination conditions.

Although some handcrafted feature descriptors are robust to illumination variation, they often rely on extra information such as image depth [17]. Instead, the
convolutional neural network (CNN) could extract the features
at different levels through a prelearning process.

Under such circumstances, this article proposes and develops
a lightweight approach to realize a long-term, real-time, and
automatic positioning, using only low-cost onboard sensors and
processors.

%cite Automaticgenerationanddetectionofhighlyreliable fiducial markers under occlusion

One of the most popular families of fiducial markers are
the square-based ones. They contain a black border to ease
their detection and employ their inner region for identication
purposes. Their main benefit is that each marker provides
four prominent points (i.e. its four corners) which can
be easily detected and employed as correspondence points,
thus allowing camera pose estimation using a single marker.



This section explains the steps employed to automatically
detect the markers in an image(Fig. 5(a)). The process is
comprised by several steps aimed at detecting rectangles and
extracting the binary code from them. For that purpose, we take as

% which computes the bounding box, number of pixels, and center of gravity on
the fly. 

 
1) Segmentation and thresholding: Starting from a pixel position p0, the algorithm classifies the current pixel as either black or white by thresholding against an adaptively set value.
In a case the pixel is classified as white, the algorithm
proceeds to the next image pixel. In case a black pixel is
found, a segment consisting of the contiguous set of black
pixels is computed using a queue-based flood-fill method, see
Algorithm 1. This black segment is tested for a possible match
of the outer ring of the pattern. At this point, these tests consist
of a minimum size (in terms of the number of pixels belonging
to the segment) and a roundness measure within acceptable
bounds. These simple constraints allow a fast rejection of false
positives. In a case either test fails, the detection for further
black segments continues starting from the next pixel position.
However, no redundant computation is performed since the
previous segment is labeled with a unique identifier.
If a black segment passes both tests, the detection resumes
from the pixel position corresponding to the segment centroid
where a white pixel is expected. In this case, the corresponding
white segment is computed using the flood-fill algorithm. If the
minimum size and roundness tests are valid, further validation
tests are performed involving the centroid positions of both
segments, their area ratio, and a more complex circularity
measure (discussed in following sections). If the segments pass
all these tests, the pattern is considered to be found and its
centroid position will be used as a starting point p0 for the
next detection run.


3) Pattern center and dimensions: Once a pattern passes all
the aforementioned tests, the queue, which has been used by
the flood-fill phase, contains positions of all the pattern pixels.
Thus, all the information to calculate the ellipse centre u; v and
semiaxes e0; e1 is at hand. The pattern center u; v is calculated
simply as the mean of the pixel positions. Then, the method
calculates the covariance matrix of the pixels positions C. The
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix correspond to the
ellipse semiaxes lengths and orientations. 

Since the matrix C is two-dimensional, its eigen decomposition
is a matter of solving one quadratic equation. Note
that if it is desirable, the most of the calculation of C can be
performed in the integer arithmetic, which might be useful if
the system runs on an embedded hardware.


cite{JIRS}

In [16], a planar pattern consisting of a ring surround-
ing the letter \H" is used to obtain the relative 6DoF
robot pose with an on-board camera and IMU (Inertial
Measurement Unit) to resolve angular ambiguity. The
pattern is initially detected by binarization using adap-
tive thresholding and later processing for connected com-
ponent labeling. For classifying each component as be-
longing to the target or not, a neural network (multilayer
perceptron) is used. The input to the neural network is a
resized 14 x 14 pixel image. After testing for certain ge-
ometric properties, false matches are discarded. Positive
matches corresponding to the outer ring are processed
by applying the Canny edge detector and ellipse tting,
which allows computation of the 5DoF pose. Recognition
of the \H" letter allows to obtain the missing yaw angle.
The precision in 3D position is in the order of 1 cm to
7 cm depending on the target viewing angle and distance,
which was at the maximum around 1:5 m.

Finally, a widely used, simple and freely available cir-
cular target detector can be found in the OpenCV li-
brary. This "SimpleBlobDetector" class is based on tra-
ditional blob detection methods and includes several op-
tional post-detection ltering steps, based on character-
istics such as area, circularity, inertia ratios, convexity
and center color. While this implementation is originally
aimed for circular target detection, by tuning the pa-
rameters it is possible to nd elliptical shapes similar
to the ones proposed in the present work and thus it is
compared to the proposed implementation.

3 Pattern detection
The core of the proposed computationally efficient local-
ization system is based on pattern detection. Fast and
precise detection is achieved by exploiting properties of
the considered pattern that is a black and white roundel
consisting of two concentric annuli with a white central
disc, see Figure 1.
The low computational requirements are met by the
pattern detection procedure based on on-demand thresh-
olding and fl
ood fill techniques, and gathering statistical
information of the pattern on the 
y. The statistical data
are used in consecutive tests with increasing complexity,
which determine if a candidate area represents the de-
sired circular pattern.
The pattern detection starts by searching for a black
segment. Once such a segment is detected and passes the
initial tests, the segment detection for a white inner disc
is initiated at the expected pattern center.
Notice, that at the beginning, there is no prior infor-
mation about the pattern position in the image; hence,
the search for the black segment is started at a ran-
dom position. Later, in the subsequent detections, when
a prior pattern position is available, the algorithm starts
detection over this area. For a successfully re-detected
(tracked) pattern, the detection processes only pixels be-
longing to the pattern itself, which signicantly reduces
the computation burden. Since the method is robust (see
following sections for detection limits), tracking is gen-
erally successful and thus the method provides very high
computational performance.
After the roundel is detected, its image dimensions
and coordinates are identied. Then, its three-dimensional
position with respect to the camera is computed from its
known dimensions and camera re-projection techniques,
and its coordinates are transformed to a coordinate frame
dened by the user, see Section 4.

segmentation
First,
a black circular ring is searched for in the input im-
age starting at an initial pixel position p0. The adaptive
thresholding classies the processed pixel using an adap-
tively set value aa as either black or white. If a black pixel
is detected, the queue-based 
ood-ll algorithm proce-
dure is initiated to determine the black segment.
Once the 
ood ll is complete, the segment is tested
for a possible match of the outer (or inner) circle of
the pattern. At this point, these tests consist of a min-
imum size (in terms of the number of pixels belonging
to the segment) and a roundness measure within accept-
able bounds.
Hence, ini-
tial simple constraints can be validated quickly for a fast
rejection of false positives.
In the case where either test fails, the detection for
further segments continues by starting from the next
pixel position (i.e., a pixel at the position p0 + 1). How-
ever, no redundant computation is performed since the
previous segment is labeled with a unique identier.

Efficient thresholding
Since the segmentation looks only for black or white seg-
ments, the success rate of the roundel detection depends
on the threshold parameter $\tau$ , especially under various
lighting conditions. Therefore, we proposed to adaptively
update aa whenever the detection fails according to a bi-
nary search scheme over the range of possible values.
When the pattern is successfully detected, the thresh-
old is updated using the information obtained during
detection in order to iteratively improve the precision of segmentation:

The computationally intensive full image threshold-
ing is addressed by on-demand processing over each pixel
analyzed during the detection. At the very rst access,
the RGB values of the image are read and a pixel is
classied as either black or white and the classication
result is stored for further re-use in the subsequent steps.
Moreover, whenever the tracking is successful, only the
relevant pixels are thresholded and processed by the two-
step 
ood ll segmentation. Clearing the per-pixel classi-
cation memory area is also efficiently performed by only
resetting the values inside the pattern's bounding box.
As a result, the detection step is not directly dependent
on the input image resolution, which provides a signi-
cant performance gain. If the tracking is not successful,
extra memory accesses resulting from this on-demand
strategy are negligible compared to a full-image thresh-
olding approach.

Compensation of incorrect diameter estimation
Moreover, the pixels on the black/white bor-
der are affected by chromatic aberration, nonlinear cam-
era sensitivity, quantization noise, and image compres-
sion

The compensation of the
pattern diameter reduces the average localization error
by approximately

Moreover,
we found that the OpenCV's blob radius calculation was
too imprecise to reliably estimate the pattern distance
and could not be used for the full 3D localization.


 Yang,
Scherer, and Zell (2013) used an H‐shaped target that could be
recognized successfully in complex scenes and had better robustness.

Ellipse extraction
Ellipses are the most significant features of the target and can give the
center of the target. Fornaciari, Prati, and Cucchiara (2014) provided a
novel real‐time algorithm called yet another ellipse detector (YAED)
relying on an innovative arc selection strategy. YAED segments contour
into four quadrants. The arcs that can group an ellipse are selected in
these quadrants. Figure 5e shows the ellipses detected by YAED.
