\subsection{Ellipse Detection}
Geometric primitive detection is a fundamental problem in image processing. Among various geometric primitives, ellipse may be the most popular one that exists both in natural and man-made environments, and therefore plays an indispensable role in many applications like traffic signs recognition, 3D scene reconstruction


In practice, the presence of noise substantially hinders the localization of the edge pixels on ellipses. Further, partial occlusions splits ellipses' borders into discrete arc segments. These issues complicates the problem 
%and therefore causes degradation in the

%compromise the detection accuracy


There are many studies on ellipse detection found in the literature and
they are classified in two categories, i.e. Hough-based and edge chaining methods.

The earliest method relied on the generalized Hough Transform for detection ellipses. Briefly,
the key concept of the HT is to cast the detection problem in the image space as a voting problem in the parameter space. More specifically, HT first establishes an accumulator in the parameter space. In the case of ellipse detection, HT needs all pixels to vote in a five dimensional parameter accumulator, i.e. the center, the major axis, the minor axis, and the orientation of the ellipse. Then, each cell of the accumulator will be voted by the pixels who lie on the primitive corresponding to the cell. 
After voting, the cells whose votes are local maxima and over a threshold correspond to the detected ellipses' parameters.

Despite its robustness to discontinuous data points, the HT based method is very time and memory consuming. 
%In light of this,
To improve the computational efficiency, some variants of HT were proposed with Randomized Hough Transform (RHT) being the most well known. RHT based methods randomly sample a certain number (3 for ellipse) of points to determine the parameters of the primitive and then vote the computed parameters with other points. 
[Xu 1990, McLaughlin 1998].
RHT alleviates the memory demands by replacing the grid accumulator with a variable-length list which grows its length only when a new entry is inserted.
%They work by splitting the five dimensional space into two or more subspaces with lesser dimensionality and deal with each of the subspaces in separate steps





The most popular approach in
these methods was to find the centers of the ellipses using
geometrical theorems and Hough transform in the first step and
finding the remaining parameters of the ellipses in the second step.McLaughlin

McLaughlin [10] rely on the randomized version of eHT(RHT)and aim at reducing the memory usage using proper data structures.

Chia et al. [16] used a one-dimensional (1D) accumulator and reduced the memory storage and computational complexity by keeping the advantages of the HT. Besides, they could achieve a shorter execution time by using parallel computation.

Apart from efficiency, the performance of all HT based methods rely on the tuning of the quantisation precision of the accumulator array.

%critical parameters


In recent years, preprocessing of arc and line segments with geometrical properties are mostly investigated.

Another class of ellipse detection approaches is based on arc segments or edge chaining. 
Instead of working on each individual pixel, methods in this class work on arcs by linking pixels based on some connectivity principles.
exploit
The main steps of these methods are to extract arcs and then group them by exploiting geometric or algebraic properties of ellipses.
Specifically, edge arcs that may consist of an ellipse are found by variety of techniques such as

Subsequently, these arcs are grouped according to the convexity-concavity [21,28,29] , arc curvature [21] , and geometric constraints [1,30–33] 

Lastly, ellipses are fitted on the grouped arc candidates using RANSAC [19,32] or least squares fitting technique [28]

Prasad et al. [21] use arc con- vexity to determine search regions where suitable arc candidates for grouping may be located. Fornaciari et al. [28] use geometric constraints as a selection strategy of arcs belonging to the same ellipse and estimate parameters by decomposing the parameter space.

guarantees the effectiveness of ellipse detection

Based on the considerations above, we propose a new approach



Although both approaches have pros and cons, many state-of-the-art algorithms
are feature-based methods and gives better results in terms of accuracy and
speed.


Prasad et al. propose a heuristic ellipse detector based on convexity and edge curvature properties [21]. Fornaciari et al. choose arcs strategically and compute parameters of ellipses with HT [6]. Arcs are classified according to their convexity and then grouped to test if they compose an ellipse or not

A better characterization could be achieved using sets of
connected edge pixels,i.e. arcs, which can be generated by linking
short straight lines [1,21–24], splitting the edge contour [25–28],
or validating connected edge pixels [29].

The ellipses parameters
are obtained using ellipse fitting methods [30,31] on a reduced set
of arcs, which are obtained grouping arcs according to their
relative position and constraints on the curvature [1,21,22,25,26],
or ellipse fitting error [23,24,27–29].

\section{Method}
briefly

In this way, detection of ellipses can be achieved even though arcs forming them are spread around the image.

The very first step of the algorithm is extracting the edge segments from the input image.

For n elliptical arcs extracted in the previous step, there are obviously 2n-1 potential combinations to join and detect ellipses.
Therefore, it becomes a troublesome procedure to test all arc combinations as the number of arcs grows

To reduce the number of arc combinations to test, we follow a proactive way by analyzing all arcs in pairwise to determine whether any pair can be part of the same ellipse or not. In other words, we try to find out whether any
two arcs are coelliptic or non-coelliptic. Once we determine any non-coelliptic arc pair, we remove all arc subsets which includes that pair from entire 2n − 1 combinations to reduce the computation time.

Determining whether an arc pair is non-coelliptic can be done in different ways.

To avoid the combinatorial explosion


First, ellipse fit is applied to all arc pixels in the current arc group and fitting error is computed. 
If the resulted error is small, i.e. ≤ 2.0 pixels, we test the current arc group for the spanned angle ratio
(SAR) which is the ratio of the total length of arcs in the group over the perimeter of the yielded ellipse.


Some arcs are not salient enough to characterize an ellipse
and are readily removed: very short arcs that are
mainly due to noise and arcs containing mostly collinear points), thus not belonging to the curved
boundary of an ellipse.


The score a in 0 1
summarizes how well the points of the three arcs composing Ei fit the boundary of the estimated ellipse:

The selection strategy first selects pairs whose arcs satisfy constraints on(i)convexity and(ii)mutual position



bmvc integral chain

Prasad et al. [18] propose an edge curvature and convexity
based ellipse detection method which first extracts the canny edge map of an image
and chains the edge points into edge segments, and then fits line segments on each edge
segment to approximately represent the edge segments. After that, they use the convexity of
line segments to get elliptic arcs and further combine elliptic arcs into ellipses. 

Patraucean
et al. [17] propose an ellipse detection algorithm named ELSD. They first exploit a seed
growing scheme to find line-support regions, and further chain the line-support regions into
curve regions based on a convexity rule and a smoothness rule. After that, they estimate an
ellipse for each curve region with a fitting technique which merges the algebraic distance
with the gradient orientation. And finally, false detections are further eliminated by a contrario
validation technique. 

More recently, Fornaciari et al. [5] propose a very fast method
to detect ellipses which first splits the canny edge map into many short elliptic arcs, and then
classify these elliptic arcs into four types by their edge direction and convexity. They define
a candidate ellipse as a triplet, i.e. a set of three arcs that satisfy a set of criteria, then use
HT to determine the parameters of the ellipses. Finally, they validate the candidate ellipses
using a criterion based on the algebraic fitting error, and perform a clustering procedure to
deal with multiple detections.

aamed
In recent years, the methods based on edge-link have greatly
improved the detection performance. The main problem of
these methods is how to determine the elliptical arcs that
belong to the same ellipse.

Prasad et al. [25] proposed a method
based on edge curvature and convexity. The search region was
provided to find eligible contours for grouping the current
contour. Pˇatrˇaucean et al. [26] proposed a parameterless line
segment and elliptical arc detector with enhanced ellipse fitting
(ELSD). The number of false alarm (NFA) method in ELSD,
inspired by Von Gioi et al. [27], was used to control the false
elliptical arcs. Fornaciar et al. [9] provided a novel algorithm
called yet another ellipse detector (YAED). YAED segmented
edge contours into four quadrants and selected three arcs
from different quadrants to construct a candidate combination
with an innovative arc selection strategy. Wang et al. [10]
proposed a top-down fitting strategy to combine edges into
ellipses. The fitting process was sped up by an integral
chain. Jia et al. [12] proposed an ellipse
detection method based on the characteristic number (CNED),
which used a modified projective invariant to get rid of the
useless candidates. It performed well in execution time and
detection accuracy. Lu et al. [31] proposed an accurate and efficient ellipse detector
by arc-support line segments. The arc-support groups were
formed by iteratively linking the arc-support line segments that
may belong to the same ellipse. 

Given an arc , all the arcs that are adjacent to A(i) must be found. KD-Tree is used to find
It will waste much
time by traversing all arcs to find all adjacent arcs.

In our case, under the hypothesis of a
quasi-affine homography H, we implicitly assume that H maps circles to ellipses




\subsection{fitting}
Ellipse fitting estimates the ellipse parameters by fitting an optimum (with respect to a criterion) ellipse to the input data.
Many methods have been proposed in the literature to address the ellipse fitting problem. Based on how they solve this problem, they can be classified as analytical or iterative. Generally, iterative methods are more accurate, but less efficient than analytical solutions.





In the deterministic category, the simplest methods for conic fitting rely on some
basic operations performed on the input data. For example, the moment-based method has
been widely used as it provides a very simple, yet efficient technique for locating circular features
when images are taken under some favorable conditions.
This method is sensitive to illumination variations, and above all, to occlusions.

With the least-squares (LS) formulation, one defines an error distance and tries to minimise
in a least-squares sense this distance between the input points and the fitted curve. We identify
two main classes of LS fitting techniques, namely algebraic and geometric fitting.

They are differentiated through the definition of the error measure: the former account for methods that
seek to minimise an error distance which has a geometric meaning (e.g. Euclidean distance)
[Ahn 2001], whereas the latter use an algebraic expression
as error distance [Fitzgibbon 1999].

In the last decades, tremendous research work was concentrated on the LS formulation (3.5-3.6)
of the circle and ellipse fitting in images, and the problem seems to be settled from a theoretical
point of view.

Geometric Fitting of Circles and Ellipses
a) Geometric fitting of circles
Geometric fitting algorithms for circles commonly use the Euclidean distance as error-of-fit
in the minimisation problem
Ahn et al. [Ahn 2001] describe non-parametric algorithms for circle and ellipse fitting,

Solving a non-linear least-squares problem is costly, as in general, no closed-form solution
exists, and therefore an iterative procedure needs to be used. In the case of ellipse fitting,
another difficulty arises, namely the computation of the error-of-fit. Finding the orthogonal
distance between a point and an ellipse requires solving a high degree polynomial.
Ahn et al. [Ahn 2001] solve simultaneously two quadratic equations through
an iterative procedure. 

Fitzgibbon et al. [Fitzgibbon 1999] were the first to propose a direct (non-iterative) ellipsespecific
fitting. They show that the ellipticity constraint 4ac − b2 > 0 can be conveniently
incorporated into the constraint h(θ) in the quadratic form
The drawback of Fitzgibbon et al.’
approach is its tendency to underestimate the eccentricity of the ellipse when the estimation is
done on incomplete data.



Existing commonly used methods for ellipse detection can
be briefly grouped into two categories: 1) Hough Transform;
2) Edge Following.

The basic idea of HT for ellipse
detection is voting arbitrary edge pixels into 5D parameter
space. The local peak will occur when the corresponding bin
of accumulator exceeds a threshold of votes, which implies
for detecting an ellipse. But it is almost impractical to directly
apply HT in practice due to the heavy computation burden and
excessive consumption of memory. To alleviate these issues,
considerable improved methods are put forward.

Instead of transforming each edge point into
a 5D parameter space, Xu et al. [20] proposed a Randomized
Hough Transform (RHT) to detect curves, which randomly
chooses five edge pixels each time and maps them into a point
of the ellipse parameter space. McLaughlin [11] combined the
aforementioned two-stage decomposition method and RHT
at the aim of reducing the computation time and improving
the detection performance compared with the standard HT,
which becomes a baseline of ellipse detection method in the
literature (Fig. 1(c)).

c)). However, it is still not efficient enough in
practice and always generates false detections due to the lack
of novel validation strategies. Despite the simplicity of HT,
HT based ellipse detection methods suffer from the following
legacy problems: First, it is vulnerable in front of substantial
image noise and complicated real-world background due to
false peaks; Second, it requires much effort to tune the model
parameters, e.g. bin size and peak threshold.

The second well-known family of ellipse detection methods
is edge following, in which the connectivity between edge
pixels, convexity of arc segments and geometric constraints are
used. The general idea of edge following always starts from
computing the binary edge map and corresponding gradients
acquired by Canny or Sobel detector [21], [22] and then
refining the arc segments from the binary edge for the ellipse
fitting.

The
ellipse detector proposed by Prasad et al. [12] incorporates the
edge curvature and convexity to extract smooth edge contours
and performs a 2D HT to rank the edge contours in a group
by the relationship scores for the better generation of ellipse
hypotheses. But it also suffers from a long computation time,
as shown in Fig. 1(d).
Another stream of edge following methods tries to extract
arc segments from binary edge directly and prunes straight
edges for the purpose of fast detection speed. The ellipse
detector proposed by Fornaciari et al. [13] assigns a bounding
box for each arc, removes the straight edges and determines
the convexity of the arc by comparing the areas of region
under and over the arc. In addition, this method accelerates
the detection process by utilizing the property of that ellipse
center should be colinear to the midpoints of parallel chords.
However, it raises the detection speed at the cost of localization
accuracy and robustness (Fig. 1(e)). Recently, the method
presented by Jia et al. [14] inherits [13] and uses the similar
convexity classification approach, but the difference lies in
that [14] filters straight edges efficiently by calculating the
edge connected component’s characteristic number, which is a
kind of projective invariant being able to distinguish the lines
and conic curves within images. [14] is fast and yet prone
to generate duplicates due to the absence of novel clustering
(Fig. 1(f)). In addition, both [13] and [14] require at least three
arc segments to recover the ellipse model, which might disable
the algorithms when handling the incomplete ellipses.

Some researchers generalize the LS detection method to be
a multi-functional detector which can jointly detect the LS
and elliptic arcs. ELSDc proposed by P˘atr˘aucean et al. [15]
uses an improved LSD [26] version for detecting LS, and
then iteratively searches the remaining LSs from the start and
end points of the detected LS. Eventually, both LS detection
and grouping tasks are established simultaneously. Notably,
ELSDc stands out other methods by detecting LSs from the
greyscale image instead of binary edge such that abundant
gradient and geometric cues can be fully exploited.
